# Maker Exchange Protocol
This is a side project from the Haystack "Maker Exchange" Residency at the Fab Lab. Stay tuned for more information about what this is all about. 

## Install 
Download and move the `client.py` file into a dedicated project directory OR clone this repo to your computer and it will automatically make a folder with the script file located inside. 

## Setup 
You need to replace the user password with your actual password. This will not run properly without making that change. 

## Run 
From within the project directory, run the following command: `python3 client.py` 
You should see a welcome message from the maker exhange.
